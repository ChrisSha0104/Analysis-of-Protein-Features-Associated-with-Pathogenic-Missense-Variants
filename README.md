# Analysis-of-Protein-Features-Associated-with-Pathogenic-Missense-Variants

The file Analysis_of_Protein_Features.py includes the source code of the graphs available in the paper Pathogenicity_Prediction_of_Missense_Variants. 

The file modified_ML_Model is machine learning model, modified from the ProteinBERT model, which predicts the pathogenicity of an unkown missense variant using a recurrent neural network. The training data & testing data are provided in the files signalP_binary.test.csv and signalP_binary.train.csv.
